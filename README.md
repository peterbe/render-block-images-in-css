This is the code for the blog post:

["Progressive CSS rendering with or without data URLs"](https://www.peterbe.com/plog/progressive-css-rendering-with-or-without-data-urls)

You can play with it by looking at the various `yarn run ...` scripts
in the `package.json`.

## The experiment URLs

* [https://www.peterbe.com/render-block-images-in-css/inlined.html](https://www.peterbe.com/render-block-images-in-css/inlined.html) - just inlined critical CSS
* [https://www.peterbe.com/render-block-images-in-css/inlined-datauri.html](https://www.peterbe.com/render-block-images-in-css/inlined-datauri.html) - same but image URLs in CSS turned into data URLs
* [https://www.peterbe.com/render-block-images-in-css/index.html](https://www.peterbe.com/render-block-images-in-css/index.html) - baseline before any optimization
